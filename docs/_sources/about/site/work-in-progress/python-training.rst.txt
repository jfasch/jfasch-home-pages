Stack: Python Beginners Training
================================

Extract beginner course from *everything*. Take exercises from Herdt,
and create a chain of exercises, thereby covering all that is
necessary.

* Look in :doc:`/trainings/log/detail/2021-01-13/index` which
  exercises were made, and put them in order with dependencies. The
  resulting dependency chain defines the main structure of the course.
* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/python_0150_datatypes_overview_compound/topic`

  Cut example code linewise into tables, giving comments in the right
  column.
* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/python_0193_while/topic`

  ``break`` and ``continue`` example, with a search in a
  sequence/list. Maybe as a livehacking screenplay.
* Eliminate Python 2 wherever I see it

  * :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/python_0150_datatypes_overview/topic`
  * :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/python_0120_helloworld/topic`
  * :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/python_0500_files/topic`

* Split exercise topics into single pieces.
