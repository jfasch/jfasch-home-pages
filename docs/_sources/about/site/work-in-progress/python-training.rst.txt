Stack: Python Beginners Training
================================

Extract beginner course from *everything*. Take exercises from Herdt,
and create a chain of exercises, thereby covering all that is
necessary.

* Look in :doc:`/trainings/log/detail/2021-01-13/index` which exercise
  were made, and put them in order.

* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/python_0150_datatypes_overview_compound/topic`

  Cut example code linewise into tables, giving comments in the right
  column.
