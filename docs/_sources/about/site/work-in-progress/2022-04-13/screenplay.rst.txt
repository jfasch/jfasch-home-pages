Screenplay
==========

Establish Initial State
-----------------------

* Establish UserDB status

  * ``db.insert(user)`` goes into a ``std::map``
  * ``bin/userdb-write-binaryfile.cpp`` fills in-memory db

    * take care to use names that do not exceed 9 chars, and email
      at 19.

* In ``bin/userdb-write-binaryfile.cpp``, think about completing write
  functionality
* Snapshot:

  Fix missing things

  * Missing user.email
  * Use shorter "Huber" instead of "Faschingbauer"

* Hack db.write() (and introduce bug). Take care to (wrongly) first
  implement functionality, and then use that in the program.
* Snapshot:
  https://github.com/jfasch/2022-04-13/commit/f383b96a866b4e9076aba5e2659ac71fe93c60a2
* Need to read, hack that right after write






Requirements
------------

* Search
* Not overwrite existing files
* Refuse to read from file when inmem already has data
* Properly defined exceptions (can start with flat unrelated exception
  types, and then be unified under a common exception type)

  Search for ``assert``
