This is work in progress (and will always be, like any software).

* Progress is happening on `Github
  <https://github.com/jfasch/jfasch-home>`__.

  .. code-block:: shell

     $ git clone https://github.com/jfasch/jfasch-home.git

* Built with `the wonderful Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__
  documentation generator. Homepages generally contain content, which
  is not much different from documentation - so yes, Sphinx is a
  really great static website generator. It lets me focus myself on
  content, with an eye towards structure and built-in link consistency
  (it won't let me break connections by just moving documents around).
* :doc:`Work in progress is tracked here <work-in-progress/index>`.
* :doc:`Here are recipes (for example, Jupyter Notebook do's and
  don'ts) <recipes>`
