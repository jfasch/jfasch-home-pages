Course Preparation
------------------

We will be using a Linux machine somewhere in the cloud, IP address
``34.107.39.200``.  Please verify that you are able to login as
follows (substitute my username with yours),

* From a Linux system, use the ``ssh`` program (substitute my username
  with yours)

  .. code-block:: console
  
     $ ssh faschingbauer.joerg@34.107.39.200
     The authenticity of host '34.107.39.200 (34.107.39.200)' can't be established.
     ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:/in22o4VCD400X0bb4FlCb5/vQnrvKvOirgfqq6maPo.
     Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
     Warning: Permanently added '34.107.39.200' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

  the same.

Day 1
.....

Linux Basics (:download:`download
</trainings/material/pdf/010-linux-basics.pdf>`), heading straight
through to the "Permissions" chapter startung on slide #92.

Exercises
`````````

* *Change Password*

  Your password on our cloud machine equals your username. From a
  security standpoint, this is suboptimal - if anybody knows your
  username, you're `pwned <https://haveibeenpwned.com/>`__.

  Change your password.

* *Create an alias*

  ``ls -al DIR`` shows a long listing of ``DIR`` (including "hidden"
  files). ``ls -al`` is relatively clumsy to type, clumsier than
  e.g. ``x``.

  For your comfort, create an alias to solve this problem. Do this in
  a way that makes the alias automatically available on next login.

* ``echo`` *suppressing linefeed*

  The ``echo`` command appends a linefeed (aka newline) to its output,

  .. code-block:: console

     $ echo this is a line because it has a newline at the end
     this is a line because it has a newline at the end
     $

  (You can see the newline character because the next prompt appears
  on a new line.)

  Which option makes ``echo`` suppress the newline character? (The
  next prompt appears right after the output, on the same line.)

* *Show file content*

  In my (username ``faschingbauer.j√∂rg``) home directory, there exists
  a subdirectory ``dumpbin``, and inside that directory exists a file
  ``easter``.

  Print the file content on the console.

* *Create dumpbin, and give colleagues write permissions*

  In your hmoe directory, create a ``dumpbin`` directory. Give your
  colleagues write permissions in that directory (btw, a colleague is
  one of the ``frcoll`` group).

* *Create a file in your colleague's dumpbin, and write-protect that
  file against the colleague*

Day 2
.....  

Again from Linux Basics (:download:`download
</trainings/material/pdf/010-linux-basics.pdf>`)

* Permissions, again (*this is important!*)
* Tools, including some live demos of pipe usage
* ``stdin``, ``stdout``, pipe short demos
