* (Good) The pipe connects one process's standard output to another

  can consume, the producer is suspended by the OS.

  produces, the consumer is suspended by the OS.
* (Good) If the pipe is neither full nor empty, producer and consumer
  can run in parallel.
* (Bad) Communication works in a way that the producer generates its
  output first (which is written to a temporary file), and then the
  consumer is kicked loose to read what has been produced.
