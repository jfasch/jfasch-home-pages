This is a training for a team which is already experienced in Python
programming. There were some special requirements for the training,
such as to loose a couple of words about AI/machinelearning and other
topics, as well as a fuzzy "bring us advanced stuff".

Advanced Core Python Topics
...........................

Python is easy; one can solve nontrivial problems in only a few lines
of code, in no time. This does not mean that you have to fully
understand the language - which is good because this is what makes the
language easy.

On the other hand, there's always a line to cross where you wish you
knew more. Here the more advanced core Python topics that shall be
covered.

* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/python_1010_generators_yield/topic`
* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/draft/context_manager`
* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/draft/encoding`
* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/draft/exceptions`
* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/python_1200_modules/topic`

  * TODO: separate *module usage* (|longrightarrow| "The ``import``
    statement", ``PYTHONPATH``, etc.)  from *module content*
    (``__all__``, ``__init__.py``, etc.)

* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/draft/duck-typing`
* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/draft/special_methods`
* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/draft/closures/topic`
* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/draft/decorators/topic`
* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/draft/starargs/topic`

Special Topics
..............

* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/draft/ai`

  * :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/draft/machine-learning-intro`
  * :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/draft/linear-regression/topic`
  * :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/draft/k-means`

* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/draft/mysql`
* Unit Testing, Test Driven Development, Design Patterns

  * Excerpt from :doc:`/trainings/repertoire/unittests`
    (:download:`/trainings/material/pdf/060-design-patterns-unittests.pdf`)
  * :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/python_5600_unittest/topic`
