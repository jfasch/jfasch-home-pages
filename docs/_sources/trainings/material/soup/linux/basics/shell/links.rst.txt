Symbolic Links, Hard Links
==========================

.. contents::
   :local:

Symbolic Links
--------------

* Look just like other directory entries (directories, files, ...)
* ... only a *reference* to one of those
* Target need not exist |longrightarrow| *Broken Link*
* Erroneous links may build cycles
* |longrightarrow| tools don't follow links by default (``cp --dereference ...``)
* Symbolic links are interpreted by the kernel (Windows: "Shortcuts";
  interpreted by File Explorer)

Commands
--------

* Create a symbolic link: ``ln -s TARGET LINK``
* ... much like ``cp`` (:doc:`here <cp>`) or ``mv`` (:doc:`here <mv>`)
* Remove symbolic link: ``rm`` (as for other directory entries)

   :caption: Symbolic link: file type

   $ ls -l /usr/bin/xzcat
   lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 2 Apr 17 11:21 /usr/bin/xzcat -> xz

Hardlinks
---------
  
* Second directory entry for the same file system element
* |longrightarrow| cannot be distinguished - there is no original and
  no copy
* Hardlink cycles would be more serious than symlink cycles
* |longrightarrow| no hardlinks to directories and hardlinks
