POSIX Timers: Threaded Notification
===================================

Signals Unwanted
----------------

* Signal handling is hard (see
  :ref:`sysprog-signals-async-signal-safe`)
* Creative ways have been found around its peculiarities
  (:doc:`/trainings/material/soup/linux/sysprog/signals/async-self-pipe/index`)
* Historically, :doc:`asynchronous delivery
  </trainings/material/soup/linux/sysprog/signals/async/index>` has
  been the only way to notify processes of something outside of their
  immediate control

oneshot
-------

* notify function (union sigval)
* remove sigaction

periodic
--------



xxx
---

* whole lotta code, mainly taken (and modified) from
  :doc:`../posix-oneshot-periodic/index`
* thread notification: is a new thread created? `man -s 3 sigevent
  <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sigevent.3type.html>`__ only
  says that it could. Performance implications?
